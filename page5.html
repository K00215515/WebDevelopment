        <h3>Hearts of Iron 4</h3>
        <p>Hearts of Iron 4 which was developed by Paradox Interactive and was released on the 6th of June 2016. The game is a strategy game which is set in 1936 (onset of World War 2). The game has no end date where you can play past the year of 1948 which is the year where the items you research within the game ends. The game features both a single player mode and a multiplayer mode. In both modes you pick a country from the start date of 1936 or in 1939.</p> 
        
        <p>In the single player mode it includes a feature which is Ironman mode where achievements can be unlocked but can't use in-game cheats and any modifications downloaded. In the multiplayer mode this feature is visible but cannot be enabled due to playing with other players. Multiplayer mode can have a maximum of 20 players, More than one player can be playing as the same country within multiplayer.</p>
            
        <p>The gameplay is good as it allows you to control the military units that you have and can become democratic, communist, fascist or neutral to achieve world domination. The game is compatiable with any modifications to the game to have more features to the game or to play as a country that never existed in 1936/ 1939. The gaming community who have purchased Hearts of Iron 4 wanted a better user interface since Hearts of Iron 3. Paradox Interactive took this into cosideration to develop a much more adaptive interface and gameplay included it into Hearts of Iron 4 to make it easier to play and quickier to adapt to the gameplay.</p>
