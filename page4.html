        <p>A newly released gaming platform is the virtual reality (VR) headset, this was released and became popular in 2015 up to the present day. These headsets work when there is a camera connected to the headset to record where you are going, handheld controllers are used to interact with your surroundings within the game and the headset is used as a screen to view what you are doing within the game.</p>
        
        <p>The headset, controllers and the cameras are connected up to a computer since the game that is compatiable with VR has to be opened on a gaming platform. Most newly released games are compatiable with VR as it is a new market for gaming and maybe the future of playing games in years to come.</p>
